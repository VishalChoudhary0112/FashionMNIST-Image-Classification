A PyTorch implementation of TinyVGG CNN for classifying FashionMNIST images, achieving 88.93% test accuracy.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the TinyVGG architecture to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset. The model achieves 88.93% testing accuracy with a loss of 0.315, demonstrating strong performance in recognizing fashion items.

**Dataset Details:**
- FashionMNIST (60,000 training + 10,000 test images)
- 10 classes (T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot)
- Grayscale images of 28x28 pixels
